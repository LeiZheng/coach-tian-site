## ** First Look before camp (营前必读)**
**For parents and children attending the physical training camp, please note (参加实体训练营的家长和孩子们请注意)：**

1. **Each person must bring two hockey sticks, 
   1. one for on-ice and one for off-ice use (每人务必带两根球杆，冰上和陆地分开)； 
   2. bring both sticks onto the ice, and place the spare one in the Box (上冰的时候把两根球杆都带上，多余的那个球杆放在Box里边)**, I will use these sticks as imaginary enemy obstacles on the ice (我会使用这些球杆在冰上做假想敌障碍物). 
   3. There will also be actions such as floating pucks and jumping (还有一些飘球跳跃等动作). 
   4. After getting off the ice, immediately do 500 air shots off-ice using the off-ice stick (下冰之后，立即在场外做500次空射门，使用陆地球杆).
   5. After each ice session, do 300 jumps while wearing skates and protective gear (每次下冰之后，做300次跳跃，穿冰刀和护具), and 100 sliding jumps, 100 each for left and right single-leg jumps (100次滑跳，每条腿各100次单刀左右跳); 
   6. these exercises are very important to do after every ice session (每次下冰之后都做这些内容，非常重要), 
   7. and then take off the protective gear to work on stickhandling or physical fitness (然后再脱掉护具，做杆上的功夫或者体能).

2. **Don't forget to bring a smooth 'green biscuit,' 
   1. preferably not the shooting type (千万别忘记带光滑的“绿饼干”，最好不是射门那种)**, because our off-ice training does not have a very good surface, and the smooth green biscuit is quite useful (因为我们的陆地训练不具备很好的地面，这种光滑的绿饼干就比较好用)! 
   2. If you forget to bring it, you will have a hard time, as others practice stickhandling, you will have to do physical training (如果忘记带了，那么你就辛苦了，别人练杆上功夫，你就得练体能), 
   3. what if you don't have one right now? Borrow from each other (如果眼下没有怎么办？互相借一下). 
   4. **This is a must-have (这个一定要有)!**

3. **Bring several sets of spare underwear, because you will sweat a lot during each training session (多带几套更换的内衣，因为每次训练都要出很多汗)**,
   1. and it is easy to catch a cold in the winter (大冬天的很容易感冒)!

4. **During lunch, check the children's eating habits (中午吃饭的时候要检查孩子们的饮食状况)**, 
   1. and for those who are picky or have poor appetite, sit with me (对于那些偏食厌食的孩子，跟我坐在一起)! 
   2. Parents, bring the food that your child usually dislikes the most, such as certain vegetables or meats, and I will watch them eat (家长把孩子平时最不喜欢吃的，比如某种蔬菜或者肉类，带过来，我看着他们吃)! 
   3. Diet is very important (饮食非常重要)！！！

## Briefing on Physical Training Camp Key Focuses (核心问题简报)
**At the same time, I would like to brief everyone on the physical training camp, and the key issues I aim to address:**

1. **Check if the Gliding Five Elements are correct (检查滑行五要素是否正确)？**
   If there are any issues, I will resolve them in the shortest time possible (如果有问题，我要用最短的时间解决它)。

2. **The 45-degree angle outer edge is something that needs to be strengthened and improved every time we get on fresh ice (45度角外刃，是每次上新冰的时候，要强化提高的)！ Because this is extremely important (因为这个太太重要了)！！！ Those who can achieve the 45-degree angle must strengthen the 30-degree angle (能完成45度角的要强化30度角)。

3. **Quantitative tests for quick shooting and scoring (快速射门得分的量化测试)：**
    - Powerful shots entering the blue line (进入蓝线的大力击射)
    - Quick wrist shots from the top of the puck circle (争球圈上沿的快速腕射)

    - Small angle 45-degree/30-degree/remote angle shots to the top corner (小角度45度/30度/偏远角度的打上角)! Usually, this angle is abandoned by the opposing defenseman and goalkeeper (通常这个角度是被对方后卫和守门员放弃的角度)!

    - There are many kung fu routines on the "8" and puck circles (“8”字和争球圈上的功夫套路特别多)
    - Only a selection can be made, determined by the age and skill level of the students on the field (只能做其中的精选，根据场上学员年龄大小水平高低来确定)

5. **High-speed passing and receiving training (传球和接球的高速度配合训练)：**
    - Medium-short distance two-person parallel quick passing and receiving, and quickly completing a quick shot (中近距离的两人平行快速传球接球，并且快速完成打快拍)
